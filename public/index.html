          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>
            Developing simple web servers in various languages has become a
            point of great learning for me in the last year or so. This project
            merely reflects that interest combined with one of my favorite
            programming languages: Rust.

          <h3>Current Scope</h3>
          <div id="motivation">
            <p>
              The Rust server is utilizing the Actix web framework along with
              Serde and others to serve the html pages and needed CSS.

              Also supported are a couple sample endpoints to demonstrate the
              various simulations that could be built out and run. Currently an
              implementation of the Volterra Predator-Prey simulation is the
              only "major" simulation able to be run.
